# 🏭 Production Efficiency Simulator Dashboard

A real-world data-driven dashboard designed to simulate, monitor, and optimize production efficiency under changing conditions — including defect rates, downtime, material shortages, and shift performance. Built using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Interactive Scenario Planner — test "What-If" defect, downtime, and material shortage scenarios.  
✅ Dynamic KPI Updates — real-time recalculation of production performance metrics.  
✅ Shift-wise Efficiency Comparison — identify underperforming or outstanding shifts.  
✅ Predictive Output Planner — machine learning-based future production forecast.  
✅ Anomaly Detection — flag unusually low-efficiency production days.  
✅ Bottleneck Analysis — determine whether downtime or material shortage is the key constraint.  
✅ Dynamic Visual Feedback — background color shifts based on defect severity.  
✅ Clean, modern, and responsive design built with Streamlit and Plotly.
